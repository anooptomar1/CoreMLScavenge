# A Simple Game developed using Core ML

WWDC 2017 brought many amazing and powerful APIs to iOS. Among the most popular is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml">Core ML</a> (of course, ARKit is hot too!). Core ML allows developers to use machine learning models in their apps without the knowledge of neural networks or machine learning algorithms. Today, I will show you how simple it is to create a game using Core ML. We will be creating a simple scavenger hunt game which will have the player running around the room looking for objects. We have already covered <a href="http://www.appcoda.com/coreml-introduction">the basics of Core ML in our tutorial</a> which I suggest you read over before continuing.
